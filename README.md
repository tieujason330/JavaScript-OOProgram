# JavaScript-OOProgram
Writing an Object Oriented program in JavaScript

Used JavaScript to implement a command console for changing settings on dynamically created objects.
The program allows the user to create classes and objects and manipulate their members. The program
supports single inheritance.

Issues: did not check if input type is incompatible due to JavaScript's lack of type defining.

Mainly tested using Chrome Console. 

#To Run
Run the code in Chrome's console and the menu/instructions will be clearly stated.
